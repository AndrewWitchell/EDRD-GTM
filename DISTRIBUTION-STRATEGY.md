# Distribution Strategy - Eat Different RD

**Purpose:** Track strategies for driving and qualifying inbound traffic
**Owner:** Eliana Witchell, MSc, RD, CDE
**Last Updated:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** Active Ideation & Planning

---

## Overview

This document tracks distribution and lead qualification strategies to scale Eliana's reach without proportionally scaling her time investment. Focus is on **intelligent automation** that maintains quality while increasing accessibility.

### Core Principle

**Quality over Quantity:** We want leads who are:
- Ready to commit to evidence-based approaches
- Dealing with metabolic conditions we can actually help
- Willing to engage with course/community model
- Not expecting quick fixes or miracle cures

---

## Backlog Ideas

### üéØ Priority 1: Voice AI Agent for Phone Inquiries

**Concept:** Replace traditional phone line with AI agent trained on Eliana's knowledge base

**The Problem:**
- Phone calls interrupt focused work time
- Many callers aren't qualified (wrong condition, wrong stage, wrong expectations)
- Same questions answered repeatedly
- Can't scale 1:1 phone time

**The Solution:**
- Voice AI agent answers calls 24/7
- Trained on Eliana's dataset (published research, patient FAQs, course content)
- Qualifies callers before taking Eliana's time
- Routes serious inquiries appropriately

**Implementation Details:**

**Technology Options:**
- **Bland AI** - Healthcare-focused voice AI
- **Vapi.ai** - Voice AI with custom knowledge bases
- **ElevenLabs + Custom LLM** - Build custom solution
- **Retell AI** - Conversational AI for phone

**Knowledge Base Training:**
- Published research papers
- Course curriculum summaries
- FAQ database from existing patients
- Eliana's published blog content
- Case study abstracts (anonymized)
- Scope of practice boundaries

**Qualification Flow:**

```

    ‚Üì
1. GREETING & CONTEXT GATHERING
   "Hi, I'm Eliana's AI assistant. I can answer questions
    about our evidence-based nutrition approach for metabolic
    health. What brings you here today?"

2. CONDITION IDENTIFICATION
   "It sounds like you're dealing with [condition].
    Let me share what our approach looks like for that..."

3. EXPECTATION SETTING
   "Our approach focuses on [evidence-based methods].
    We don't promise quick fixes. Does this align with
    what you're looking for?"

4. QUALIFICATION QUESTIONS
   - Medical history relevant to services
   - Current providers (need physician relationship)
   - Timeline expectations (realistic vs. unrealistic)
   - Budget/insurance questions
   - Previous diet attempts

5. ROUTING DECISION
   ‚úÖ QUALIFIED ‚Üí Schedule callback with Eliana
   ‚úÖ GOOD FIT FOR COURSE ‚Üí Send preview link via SMS

```

**Metrics to Track:**
- Call volume by hour/day
- Qualification rate (% who are good fits)
- Most common questions
- Most common disqualifiers

- Conversion rate (AI ‚Üí 1:1 booking)

**Privacy & Compliance:**
- HIPAA considerations for health information
- Recording consent upfront
- Data retention policy
- Scope of practice disclaimers
- "Not medical advice" messaging

**Benefits:**
- 24/7 availability (different time zones)
