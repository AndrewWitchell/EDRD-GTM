## üìã NOTES

### Why Headshot Wasn't Found
The existing eatdifferentrd.com website (on Squarespace) doesn't have an easily accessible headshot in the page source. Possible reasons:
1. Image is dynamically loaded by Squarespace's CMS
2. Image is in a gallery or password-protected section
3. Image hasn't been added to the public website
4. Image is embedded in a way that web scraping tools can't access

### Next Steps
1. **Request from Eliana:**
   - Professional headshot (preferred method)
   - High-res version for best quality

2. **Alternative Sources:**
   - LinkedIn profile photo
   - Professional photography session (if needed)
   - Existing marketing materials

3. **Temporary Solution:**
   - Current placeholder with "Professional Photo (Placeholder)" label
   - Website is fully functional without it
   - Can be swapped in easily when available

## üîß HOW TO ADD IMAGES WHEN AVAILABLE

### Adding Eliana's Headshot:
1. Place image file in: `/public/images/eliana-headshot.jpg`
2. Update `components/Hero/index.tsx` line 62-84:
   ```tsx
   <Image
     src="/images/eliana-headshot.jpg"
     alt="Eliana Witchell, MSc, RD, CDE - Registered Dietitian"
     width={500}
     height={500}
     className="rounded-2xl shadow-lg"
     priority
   />
   ```

### Adding Favicon:
1. Place files in: `/public/`
   - favicon.ico
   - favicon-32x32.png
   - favicon-16x16.png
2. Update `app/(site)/head.tsx` to reference new favicons

### Adding Open Graph Image:
1. Place in: `/public/images/og-image.jpg`
2. Add to `app/(site)/page.tsx` metadata:
   ```tsx
   openGraph: {
     images: ['/images/og-image.jpg'],
   }
   ```

## üì∏ IMAGE OPTIMIZATION TIPS

All images should be:
- **Compressed** using tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Squoosh
- **Properly sized** (don't use 4000px images when 500px will do)
- **Next.js Image optimized** (we're using `next/image` component automatically)
- **Alt text included** for accessibility and SEO
- **WebP format** considered for better compression (Next.js handles this automatically)

**Priority:** High (Headshot), Medium (Course images, Blog images), Low (Testimonial photos)
