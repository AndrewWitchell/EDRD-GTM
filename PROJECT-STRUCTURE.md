# EDRD Project Structure Documentation
**Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** October 20, 2025, 23:15:00  
**Purpose:** Define the canonical file structure and update workflow

## VERSIONING WORKFLOW

### When to Create a New Version

**Before major updates:**
1. Copy current file to timestamped archive
2. Update the current file
3. Note what changed in BUILD-LOG.md

**Example:**
```bash
# Before updating WBS
cp WBS.md WBS-20251020-231500.md

# Update WBS.md with new information

# Add entry to BUILD-LOG.md noting what changed
```

### Version Naming Convention

**Format:** `FILENAME-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`

**Examples:**
- `WBS-20251020-231500.md`
- `JTBD-RESEARCH-v2-0-20251025-140000.md`
- `BUILD-LOG-20251020-231500.md`

### Semantic Versioning (for major updates)

Use for JTBD-RESEARCH when framework fundamentally changes:
- `JTBD-RESEARCH-v1-0-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` (initial version)
- `JTBD-RESEARCH-v2-0-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` (after Eliana's answers integrated)
- `JTBD-RESEARCH-v3-0-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` (after all 6 interviews complete)

---

## UPDATE WORKFLOW PER SESSION

### At Start of Session:
1. Read `PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md` (this file)
2. Read `PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` for context
3. Read `WBS.md` for current tasks
4. Read `BUILD-LOG.md` (last 2-3 entries) for recent context
5. Read `website/.claude.md` for technical standards and commit requirements

### During Session:
- Update `WBS.md` as tasks progress
- Take notes of insights for BUILD-LOG
- Create/update content in appropriate file

### At End of Session:
1. **Update WBS.md** with final status
2. **Update BUILD-LOG.md** (REQUIRED for every commit) including:
   - What was built
   - Key insights/breakthroughs
   - What worked and why
   - Next steps
   - Commit hash
3. **Update PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md** if file structure or workflow changed
4. **Version any heavily updated files** (create timestamped copy before next session)
5. **Update PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md** if strategy changed
6. **Provide download links** for all updated files

### üö® CRITICAL: Pre-Commit Checklist

**BEFORE EVERY GIT COMMIT:**

- [ ] BUILD-LOG.md updated with session summary
- [ ] PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md updated if needed
- [ ] Code changes tested locally (`npm run build` passes)
- [ ] All files formatted (`npm run format`)
- [ ] Commit message follows format (see website/.claude.md)

**Why This Matters:**
- BUILD-LOG.md is the single source of truth for project history
- Prevents lost context between sessions
- Enables proper handoffs and continuity
- Documents evolution of decisions

See `website/.claude.md` for complete commit requirements and standards.

**For strategy work:** Load PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md + JTBD-RESEARCH.md  
**For new sessions:** Load all 8 files (establish full context)  

---

## STATUS TRACKING

### Task Status Markers (in WBS.md)
- √É¬¢√Ö‚Äú√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ **Complete** - Work is done and validated
- √É¬∞√Ö¬∏√Ö¬°√Ç¬ß **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- √É¬¢√Ç¬¨√Ö‚Äú **Not Started** - On roadmap but not begun
- √É¬∞√Ö¬∏√¢‚Ç¨¬ù√Ç¬¥ **Blocked** - Cannot proceed (note blocker in comments)

### File Update Status (in BUILD-LOG.md)
Track which files were modified each session:
```markdown
## Session [N]: [Title] ([Date])
**Files updated:**
- √É¬¢√Ö‚Äú√Ç¬è√É¬Ø√Ç¬∏√Ç¬è WBS.md (status updates)
- √É¬¢√Ö‚Äú√Ç¬è√É¬Ø√Ç¬∏√Ç¬è JTBD-RESEARCH.md (2 new job stories added)
- √É¬∞√Ö¬∏√¢‚Ç¨≈ì√Ç¬¶ CONTENT-ASSETS.md (LinkedIn post added)
```

---

## QUALITY CHECKS

### Before Ending a Session

**Completeness check:**
- [ ] All work is captured in appropriate file
- [ ] WBS status reflects actual progress
- [ ] BUILD-LOG has session summary
- [ ] No orphaned insights or decisions

**Version check:**
- [ ] Significant updates are timestamped
- [ ] Current files have no timestamps
- [ ] Archive is organized if needed

**Handoff check:**
- [ ] Next steps are clear in WBS
- [ ] Blockers are documented
- [ ] Questions for Eliana are logged
- [ ] Download links provided

---

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### √É¬¢√Ç¬ù√Ö‚Äô DON'T:
- Create new files for session updates (use BUILD-LOG.md)
- Leave timestamps on current working files
- Store insights in chat without documenting
- Update files without noting in BUILD-LOG
- Create duplicate content across files
- Make new files for "quick reference" (consolidate instead)

### √É¬¢√Ö‚Äú√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ DO:
- Update existing files with new information
- Archive timestamped versions before major changes
- Capture all insights in BUILD-LOG
- Keep current files clean (no timestamps)
- Reference other files by name (clear dependencies)
- Consolidate related content in appropriate files

---

## MIGRATION FROM OLD STRUCTURE

### Files Being Consolidated

**Old structure (12 files):**
- PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md √É¬¢√Ö‚Äú√¢‚Ç¨¬¶
- edrd-wbs-20251020-225112.md √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ WBS.md
- level5-builder-build-log-20251020-225112.md √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ BUILD-LOG.md
- jtbd-framework-update-from-transcripts.md √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ JTBD-RESEARCH.md
- clarifying-questions-for-eliana.md √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ CLARIFYING-QUESTIONS.md
- lead-magnet-tools-from-jtbd.md √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ LEAD-MAGNET-STRATEGY.md
- level-5-builder-persona-framework.md √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ CONTENT-ASSETS.md (side quest section)
- linkedin-post-level5-builder-v6-FINAL.md √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ CONTENT-ASSETS.md (published)
- session-5-summary-20251020-225112.md √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ BUILD-LOG.md (archived session)
- session-6-case-studies-update-20251020-225112.md √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ BUILD-LOG.md (archived session)
- linkedin-post-level5-builder.md √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ DELETE (superseded by FINAL)

**New structure (8 files):**
- PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md (NEW)
- PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md (updated)
- WBS.md (renamed, no timestamp)
- BUILD-LOG.md (renamed, no timestamp, includes sessions)
- CLARIFYING-QUESTIONS.md (renamed, no timestamp)
- JTBD-RESEARCH.md (renamed, no timestamp)
- LEAD-MAGNET-STRATEGY.md (renamed, no timestamp)
- CONTENT-ASSETS.md (NEW, consolidates persona + post)

### Migration Checklist
- [ ] Create PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md (this file)
- [ ] Create 7 other core files with current content
- [ ] Verify all content is preserved
- [ ] Move old files to /archive/
- [ ] Update PROJECT-INSTRUCTIONS.md to reference new structure
- [ ] Test workflow with new structure

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### This structure is working if:
- √É¬¢√Ö‚Äú√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ Can find any piece of information in <30 seconds
- √É¬¢√Ö‚Äú√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ No confusion about "which version is current"
- √É¬¢√Ö‚Äú√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ New sessions start quickly (clear context loading)
- √É¬¢√Ö‚Äú√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ No duplicate information across files
- √É¬¢√Ö‚Äú√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ Easy to see what's changed since last session
- √É¬¢√Ö‚Äú√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ Clear handoff between Andrew and Claude
- √É¬¢√Ö‚Äú√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ Eliana can review only what's relevant to her

### Red flags that structure needs adjustment:
- √É¬∞√Ö¬∏√Ö¬°√Ç¬© Creating "quick reference" files frequently
- √É¬∞√Ö¬∏√Ö¬°√Ç¬© Searching multiple files for same information
- √É¬∞√Ö¬∏√Ö¬°√Ç¬© Version confusion (multiple "current" files)
- √É¬∞√Ö¬∏√Ö¬°√Ç¬© Insights lost in chat history
- √É¬∞√Ö¬∏√Ö¬°√Ç¬© Taking >5 minutes to load context
- √É¬∞√Ö¬∏√Ö¬°√Ç¬© Duplicate tracking in multiple places

---

## FUTURE SCALABILITY

### When Project Grows
If files become too large (>500 lines), consider:

**JTBD-RESEARCH.md** could split into:
- JTBD-RESEARCH-FRAMEWORK.md (segments, jobs, needs)
- JTBD-RESEARCH-INTERVIEWS.md (transcript analyses)

**CONTENT-ASSETS.md** could split into:
- CONTENT-ASSETS-EDRD.md (main project)
- CONTENT-ASSETS-LEVEL5.md (side quest)

**WBS.md** stays unified (critical for tracking)

**BUILD-LOG.md** stays unified (critical for history)

### When to Create Sub-Projects
If a section becomes its own project:
- B2B2C Healthcare Network √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ own project structure
- Institutional Training √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ own project structure
- Level 5 Builder √É¬¢√¢‚Ç¨¬†√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ own project structure

Each gets its own 8-file structure.

---

## VERSION HISTORY

---

## APPENDIX: Quick Reference Commands

### Check Current Structure
```bash
ls -lh /mnt/project/*.md | grep -v archive
# Should show exactly 13 .md files (no timestamps)
```

### Create Version Before Major Update
```bash
cp WBS.md WBS-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).md
# Then update WBS.md
```

### Find All Versions of a File
```bash
ls -lh /mnt/project/archive/**/WBS-*.md
```

### Verify No Duplicate Content
```bash
grep -r "specific phrase" /mnt/project/*.md
# Should appear in only ONE file
```

---

**Remember: This structure exists to serve the work, not the other way around. If it's not working, we adapt it.**
