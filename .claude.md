# Project Instructions for Claude

## Git Workflow

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit changes unless explicitly instructed by the user.**

The workflow is:
1. Make code changes as requested
2. User tests changes locally in browser
3. User confirms changes are working
4. User initiates the commit themselves

Never automatically commit changes, even if they appear to be working. The user must verify functionality first.
